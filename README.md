# Video Memorability Prediction using Python libraries like sklearn, and keras

The purpose of predicting video memorability is to predict the quality of a video based on various features. People are presented with numerous photos and videos consistently; however, they have this extraordinary capacity to recall the subtleties, despite the fact that a considerable lot of them look basically the same. It is important so that we can organize and retrieve digital content and use it as per our needs. Semantic features and features like captions are useful in finding video memorability. In this, features like InceptionV3 and C3D with linear regression and decision tree regressor machine learning models are used. This prediction is made using 2000 test features of each type. The dataset consists of 6000 dev- set videos and 2000 testset videos. It comes with long-term and short-term annotations. Video Memorability is predicted using decision tree regressor as it gives better output with Spearmanâ€™s Ranking coefficient.
